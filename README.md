# AngularJS-Todo-App
A todo list app I built following a tutorial at teamtreehouse.com. I am not the original author of this code. Also, it's not completely finished - the todos aren't saved in any way so a page refresh wipes them out. My main goal with this project was to learn more about AngularJS.
